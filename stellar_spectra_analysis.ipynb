    "# Stellar Parameter and Abundance Estimation using ML\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "This project began as a senior honours dissertation to analyse Milky Way Survey (MWS) spectra from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and estimate stellar parameters — effective temperature ($T_\\text{eff}$), surface gravity ($\\log g$), and metallicity [Fe/H] — along with detailed chemical abundances, using machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "This work is essential for improving current techniques used to infer these stellar quantities from observed spectra. Better estimates lead to more accurate models of stellar populations and a deeper understanding of Galactic structure and evolution, particularly how stellar populations differ based on their location within the Milky Way.\n",
    "\n",
    "We apply two main ML strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Random Forest Regression with PCA for dimensionality reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Neural Networks for learning complex mappings from spectra to parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Future work includes integrating physics-informed loss functions to guide the models using astrophysical priors and improve physical reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook walks through:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Preprocessing the DESI spectra (e.g., Doppler correction, flux normalization),\n",
    "\n",
    "- Training and evaluating ML models for parameter estimation,\n",
