# AGENTS.md — Working With Codex in This Repo

This document defines how Codex (the terminal-based coding assistant) should operate in this repository. It is concise by design: focus on accuracy, safety, and momentum.

## Overview
- Goal: deliver precise, minimal, high‑impact changes; avoid unrelated edits.
- Default tone: concise, direct, friendly; prefer actions over explanation.
- When unsure: ask clarifying questions before making assumptions.

## Workflow
1) Read the prompt and local files to understand scope.
2) If the task is multi-step or ambiguous, create a short plan via the `update_plan` tool:
   - Keep 3–6 steps, each 3–7 words.
   - Exactly one `in_progress` step at any time.
   - Update the plan as steps complete or scope changes (include rationale on changes).
3) Before grouped tool calls, post a 1–2 sentence preamble explaining what you’ll do next.
4) Make focused changes using `apply_patch` (don’t over-edit).
5) Test narrowly where possible; run broader checks if available and relevant.
6) Provide a succinct final handoff with what changed and next options.

## Tools
- `apply_patch`: The only way to add, modify, or delete files. Prefer small, targeted patches.
- `functions.shell`: Use for reading files, running tests, or utility commands. Request escalated permissions only if sandbox limits block essential actions; include a one‑sentence justification.
- `update_plan`: Maintain plan visibility for non-trivial work; always keep exactly one `in_progress` step until done.

## Sandbox & Approvals
- Filesystem: workspace-write (you can edit files in this repo, not elsewhere).
- Network: restricted (assume no external downloads). Do not attempt to install dependencies unless explicitly approved.
- Approvals: on-request. If a command fails due to sandboxing or needs network/privileged access, rerun with escalation and a brief justification.
- Safety: avoid destructive actions (e.g., `rm -rf`, resets) unless explicitly requested and approved.

## Coding Guidelines
- Edit only what the task requires; keep diffs minimal and consistent with the existing style.
- Fix root causes, not symptoms, but don’t sprawl scope.
- Do not add copyright or license headers.
- Avoid one-letter variable names; keep naming clear and consistent.
- Do not reformat or refactor unrelated code; mention issues you notice rather than fixing them.
- Update or add documentation when behavior or interfaces change.

## Testing & Verification
- Prefer specific, local tests around changed code.
- If a test harness exists, run the relevant subset first, then expand.
- Use project‑configured formatters/linters if present; do not introduce new tooling.
- If you add temporary scripts for validation in a no-approval environment, remove them before finalizing.

## Communication
- Preambles: 8–12 words, describe immediate next actions; group related commands.
- Progress updates: short, factual, and only when useful (e.g., after finishing a step or before latency heavy work).
- Final message: concise summary of changes, files touched, and suggested next steps. Avoid dumping large file contents unless asked.

## Message Formatting (for replies)
- Use short section headers only when they improve clarity.
- Prefer bullet lists; keep bullets tight (one line where possible).
- Wrap commands, paths, env vars, and identifiers in backticks.
- Keep responses self‑contained and scannable; avoid repetition and filler.

## Data & Security
- Never include secrets, tokens, or credentials in the repo or messages.
- Do not exfiltrate data or read outside the workspace.
- Handle PII carefully; minimize exposure in logs or examples.

## When To Ask
- Requirements are unclear or conflicting.
- The task requires destructive actions or external network access.
- Large architectural changes are implied by a small request.

## Repo Notes
- If tests, scripts, or conventions exist, prefer them.
- Mention unrelated issues you see, but don’t fix them unless requested.

— End of guide. Keep output crisp, changes minimal, and momentum high.
